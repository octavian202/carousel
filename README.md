# Carousel
I've made a simple carousel with help from the Scrimba CSS & JS fundamentals challenges and I've also added a short animation (it looks like it slides) to make it look better to the eye.

I also want to add some new features, like some dots at the bottom of the photo to let the user know which slider they're on and maybe some text. I could also try to add an animation for the dots at the bottom, when I'll find how to make them work properly.
