# Carousel
I've made a simple carousel with help from the Scrimba CSS & JS fundamentals challenges and I've also added a short animation (it looks like it slides) to make it look better to the eye.

I think I am satisfied, for now, with this version of the carousel, which is not very complex, but I am looking forward into learning new things and practicing those things on this p[roject to make it even better.
